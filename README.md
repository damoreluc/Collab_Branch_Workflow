Esercizio sul workflow collaborativo

## Feature Branches

Rather than working directly on master/main, all new development should be done on separate branches.

* Treat master/main branch as the official project history

* Multiple teamates can collaborate on a single feature and share code back and forth without polluting the master/main branch

* Master/main branch won't contain broken code, or at least, it won't unless someone messes up.
